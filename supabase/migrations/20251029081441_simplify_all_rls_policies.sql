/*
  # Simplify all RLS policies to avoid recursion

  1. Changes
    - Drop all policies that cause cross-table recursion
    - Use app_metadata for role checks exclusively
    - Make policies simple and direct

  2. Security
    - Super admins have full access to everything
    - Admins have access within their organization
    - Other users have limited access
