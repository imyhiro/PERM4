/*
  # Recreate All Users Table Policies Correctly
  
  ## Problem
  Missing policies for super_admin and consultants on users table.
  Also, some policies that use get_user_role() may still cause issues.
  
  ## Solution
  Create a complete set of policies for all roles:
  - Own profile access (no role check needed)
  - Super admin access (uses get_user_role())
  - Admin access (uses get_user_role())
  - Consultant access (uses get_user_role())
  
  ## Important
  The "own profile" policies MUST NOT call get_user_role() to avoid recursion.
