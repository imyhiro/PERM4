  # Add admin policies for UPDATE and DELETE operations

  1. Changes
    - Add policy for admins to update any user
    - Add policy for admins to delete any user (except super_admins)
    - Keep existing self-update policy
    - Keep existing policies for SELECT and INSERT

  2. Security
    - Super admins can update/delete anyone
    - Admins can update/delete non-super_admin users
    - Regular users can only update themselves
    - No one can delete super_admins except other super_admins
