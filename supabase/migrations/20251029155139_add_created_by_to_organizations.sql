/*
  # Add created_by field to organizations table
  
  ## Changes
  1. Add `created_by` column to organizations table
     - References users(id)
     - Nullable to support existing records
  
  2. Update RLS policies for organizations
     - Super admins can view all organizations
     - Admins can only view organizations they created
     - Consultants and readers can view their organization
  
  3. Security
     - Maintain restrictive RLS policies
     - Ensure proper role-based access
