/*
  # Fix All Tables - Remove public.users Queries from RLS Policies
  
  ## Problem
  Multiple tables have RLS policies that query public.users directly, causing
  "permission denied for table users" errors due to RLS recursion.
  
  ## Solution
  Replace ALL direct queries to public.users with helper function calls:
  - Use get_user_role() instead of querying users.role
  - Use get_user_organization_id() instead of querying users.organization_id
  
  ## Tables Fixed
  - asset_catalog
  - threat_catalog
  - asset_threat_compatibility
  - scenarios
  - site_assets
  
  ## Security
  - All policies maintain the same security model
  - Helper functions access auth.users only (no RLS recursion)
