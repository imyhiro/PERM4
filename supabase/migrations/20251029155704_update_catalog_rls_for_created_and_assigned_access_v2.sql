  # Update Catalog RLS Policies for Created and Assigned Access
  
  ## Overview
  This migration updates RLS policies for sites, assets, and threats to allow:
  - **Super admins**: Full access to everything
  - **Admins**: Access to records in organizations they created OR sites they have access to
  - **Consultants**: Access to records in sites they have access to (can create/update)
  - **Readers**: View-only access to records in sites they have access to
  
  ## Changes
  
  ### Sites Table
  - Update admin SELECT policy to include created organizations and assigned sites
  - Update admin INSERT/UPDATE policies to include assigned sites
  - Add consultant INSERT/UPDATE policies for assigned sites
  
  ### Assets Table
  - Update admin policies to include sites from created organizations and assigned sites
  - Update consultant policies for assigned sites
  - Add reader policies for view-only access
  
  ### Threats Table
  - Update admin policies to include sites from created organizations and assigned sites
  - Update consultant policies for assigned sites
  - Add reader policies for view-only access
  
  ## Security
  - All policies check authentication
  - Role-based access through app_metadata
  - Site access verified through user_site_access table
  - Organization ownership verified through created_by field
