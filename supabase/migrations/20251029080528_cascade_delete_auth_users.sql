  # Cascade delete auth users when deleting from users table

  1. Changes
    - Create function to delete from auth.users when user is deleted
    - Create trigger to automatically cascade the deletion
    - Clean up orphaned auth.users entries that don't have a users record

  2. Security
    - Only affects deletion operations
    - Ensures auth and profile data stay in sync
